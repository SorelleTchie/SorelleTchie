    Aspiring Software  Engineer with a BSc in Biology and certified in Google IT Automation with Python and Google IT Support Professional Certificate.

In parallel with my day-to-day work, I've been developing my programming skills and I am currently working on several projects using Python, Django, Bootstrap, Panda, NumPy, MATLAB, MYSQL HTML, CSS, and SQLite. My most recent project is a dynamic web application that focuses on employee management. The main functions of this application are: registration of new employees, generation of unique ID numbers, and tracking employee hours. I invite you to view this project, and to check on my profile regularly for any updates

My goal is to leverage my existing skills and my growing knowledge in programming to transition into a Software Engineering role where I can contribute to building efficient, scalable and secure systems.

I'm always interested in connecting with other tech enthusiasts, potential collaborators, and recruiters looking for passionate, Software engineers."
