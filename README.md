        Hi! My name is Sorelle, and i am interested in Information technology. I do not currently hold a degree in information technology,
        but i do have a Bachelors in Biology. On August 5th 2021 i completed IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate on Cousera, 
        and i am using HackerRank to sharpen my skills in Python, Regex,Linux Shell, and SQL. I am definitely looking for other project 
        opportunities that could help me put in practice all that i learned from My certificate. I am submitting my Express Entrie profile to
        immigrate to Canada, and landing a job there will be ideal for me.
        The easisest way to reach me is through my email: sorelletchie@gmail.com .
