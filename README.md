    Transitioning IT Support Technician and aspiring Backend Engineer with a BSc in Biology and certified in Google IT Automation with Python and Google IT Support Professional Certificate. Currently, I bring my strong problem-solving skills and quick learning abilities to my role as an IT Support Technician, ensuring efficient resolution of technical issues and maintaining high levels of user satisfaction.

In parallel with my day-to-day work, I've been developing my programming skills and I am currently working on several projects using Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and SQLite. My most recent project is a dynamic web application that collects and saves new employee information to a database while generating unique IDs for each employee. I invite you to view this project, and to check on my profile regularly for any updates

My goal is to leverage my existing skills and my growing knowledge in programming to transition into a Backend Engineer or Software Developer role where I can contribute to building efficient, scalable and secure systems.

I'm always interested in connecting with other tech enthusiasts, potential collaborators, and recruiters looking for passionate, backend engineers."
